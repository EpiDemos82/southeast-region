# Bioinformatics Resources for the AMD Southeast Region
This is the place where you can find all updated bioinformatics resources for the Southeast Region.

Southeast Region members:
* Alabama
* Georgia (Workforce Development (WFD) Lead)
* Florida (Bioinformatics Regional Resource (BRR) Lead)
* Louisiana
* Mississippi
* Puerto Rico

## HiPerGator Resources
All Southeast region members have free access to shared computational resources on the high-performance computing (HPC) cluster at the University of Florida, known as "HiPerGator". Each state has their own storage allocation and has access to 64 CPUs to run analyses.
Additionally, each user has access to a local instance of Galaxy, maintained by UF's Research Computing staff.
To request a HiPerGator account, please follow these [instructions](hipergator/20200807_SoutheastRegion_HiPerGatorAccountAccess.pdf).
